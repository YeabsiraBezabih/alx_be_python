## Tasks

### 0. Basic Arithmetic Exercise
**File:** `basic_operations.py`

**Objective:** To practice basic arithmetic operations in Python by performing predefined calculations.

**Description:**
- Assign specific values to two variables: `number1 = 10` and `number2 = 5`
- Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication on these numbers
- Print the results in a human-readable format

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 basic_operations.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
```

### 1. Simple Interest Calculator
**File:** `simple_interest.py`

**Objective:** Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate simple interest.

**Description:**
- Calculate simple interest using the formula: `I = P * R * T`
- Where: P = Principal ($1000), R = Rate (5%), T = Time (3 years)
- Print the calculated interest

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 simple_interest.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
The simple interest is: 150.0
```

### 2. Calculate the Area of a Rectangle
**File:** `rectangle_area.py`

**Objective:** Use basic Python arithmetic operations to calculate the area of a rectangle.

**Description:**
- Calculate area using the formula: `Area = length Ã— width`
- Use predefined values: `length = 10`, `width = 5`
- Print the calculated area

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 rectangle_area.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
The area of the rectangle is: 50
```

### 3. Convert Hours to Seconds
**File:** `hours_to_seconds.py`

**Objective:** Demonstrate understanding of variable assignments and arithmetic operations by converting hours to seconds.

**Description:**
- Convert a given number of hours to seconds
- Use the conversion: 1 hour = 3600 seconds
- Print the result in a readable format

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 hours_to_seconds.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 hour(s) is 7200 seconds.
```

### 4. User Input Age Calculator
**File:** `future_age_calculator.py`

**Objective:** Practice receiving user input in Python and perform arithmetic operations.

**Description:**
- Prompt user for their current age
- Calculate how old they will be in 2050 (assuming current year is 2023)
- Handle user input and display the result

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 future_age_calculator.py
```

**Example Interaction:**
```
How old are you? 30
In 2050, you will be 57 years old.
```
